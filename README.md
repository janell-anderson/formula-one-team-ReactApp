# formula-one-team-ReactApp

## Summary
I will be taking a project I have done while in General Assembly and recoding it with React. The original was used with the MVC model. Instead of using Views I will be using React.

The original is here: https://github.com/janell-anderson/formula-team-app

## User Experience
The user will be able to see the current teams that are currently taken part in the 2018 season. They will also see the current drivers that are in the season. They will be able to see the information on each team and each driver respectively. They will also have ability to create there own dream team. They can choose the team of there choice in the current season and the drivers they would pair up in that chosen team.
